    These are issues or changes for the root Servercide code

      <li>when rediscovering an app, the state needs to come back in consistent fashion (<b>flexgrid</b> dash currently updates
        correctly once then breaks)</li>

    <span class="header1">Decentralization</span>
    These goals are not clearly defined, and the best short term solution may be to simply leverage existing tools
    (my favored projects for this path being IPFS and iota). Under this method however emt can never be entirely self-contained.
    <ul style="text-align:left;">
      <li>Formalize programmatically turning class defs into json</li>
      <li>Write a concensus algorithm which
        <ul>
          <li>does not require storing the entire history</li>
          <li>always delivers/makes available the servercide engine, jquery, bluebird IE promises shim</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Establish a graph data-based file storage pattern secured by the concensus algorithm, starting with the
        json class defs of the existing servercide apps and expanding into user storage</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://webtorrent.io/">webtorrents</a> for accessing the data lazily</li>
    </ul>

    <span class="header1">Apps</span>
    These are usable apps intended to provide functionality available when the decentralization is eventually sorted.
