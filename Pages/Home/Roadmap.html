    These goals are not clearly defined, and the best short term solution may be to simply leverage existing tools.
    I believe the best projects for this path are currently IPFS and iota, I haven't experimented with them much yet
    because
    under this method emt is not entirely self-contained.
    <ul style="text-align:left;">
      <li>Formalize programmatically turning class defs into json</li>
      <li>Write a concensus algorithm which
        <ul>
          <li>does not require storing the entire history</li>
          <li>always delivers/makes available the servercide engine, jquery, bluebird IE promises shim</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Establish a graph data-based file storage pattern secured by the concensus algorithm, starting with the
        json class defs of the existing servercide apps and expanding into user storage</li>
      <li>Use <a href="https://webtorrent.io/">webtorrents</a> for accessing the data lazily</li>
    </ul>

    These are usable apps intended to provide functionality available when the decentralization is eventually sorted.
